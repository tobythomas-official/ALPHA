# ALPHA
## My Portfolio Website
Welcome to **ALPHA**, my website and the beginning of my journey into full-stack web development.

## ðŸš€ About This Project

This portfolio site was developed with the guidance of a YouTube channel titled *"How to Become a Developer"*. 
It marks a significant step forward from my first basic web project, which I created during my 10th grade.

During my graduation, I revisited web development for my major project. 
At that time, it was a tough challengeâ€”especially with only basic front-end knowledge. 
I turned to AI tools and online tutorials to help me navigate the process and bring the project to life.

## ðŸ“š Learning & Growth

Driven by a desire to improve, I decided to build this website entirely on my own. 
I made a conscious effort to learn and apply both front-end and back-end technologies.
While some parts of the code may resemble copy-paste examples, they were essential for understanding key concepts and workflows.

My approach is to learn by doingâ€”creating projects, facing challenges, and finding solutions.

## ðŸ§­ Why "ALPHA"?

I named this repository **ALPHA** because it symbolizes *The Beginning*â€”the start of my journey toward becoming a skilled web developer.
